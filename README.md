# Pig-Latin
# Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and appends an "ay". If a word begins with a vowel you just append "way". Finaly, restore the first letter case of the Pig Latin word to match the English word.

English	    ->    Pig Latin
hello	    ->    ellohay
shellfish	->    ellfishshay
envelope	->    envelopeway

# Pig-Latin
Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and appends an "ay". If a word begins with a vowel you just append "way". Finaly, restore the first letter case of the Pig Latin word to match the English word.

1. English	    ->    Pig Latin
2. hello	      ->    ellohay
3. shellfish	  ->    ellfishshay
4. envelope	    ->    envelopeway
